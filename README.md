#About
A node-webit client to connect to the TwitchIRC servers while also replicating some features of the default chat.

#TODO
Add mod & sub icons - Not sure how I can tell if someone is a sub yet
Add in mod / caster features
Add in userlist & count
Add in emote list - Need to figure out how to authenticate the current user to twitch to get their sub emotes
